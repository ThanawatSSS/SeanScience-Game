# SeanScience-Game 🎮
An educational project. It's a 3D platformer game designed to teach basic science concepts. Developed using Unreal Engine 5.4 (Blueprint) and Blender.
Some assets are from the Unreal Marketplace, but most were created from scratch.

## Source code 📝
I can't upload the entire source here because it's about 13GB (unclean and unoptimized). It contains raw Blueprints, assets, and some unused or duplicated files.
But hey, it works — and that’s what matters.

⚠️ If you want to open it, make sure you're using Unreal Engine version 5.4.4.
Here's the source code (available until my college deletes the Google account associated with it):
